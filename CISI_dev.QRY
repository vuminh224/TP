Library Networks and Resource Sharing in the United States:
An Historical and Philosophical Overview
.A
Stevens, N.D.
.W
    This paper discusses the origins of library networks and traces their
development in the United States in the late 1960s through the present.
The concept of resource sharing, with particular attention to the inter-
library loan and programs for the cooperative acquisition and storage of
materials, is examined in relationship to library networks.  In particular,
attention is given to the question of how these two major components of
library cooperation, which have tended to be separate, might become more
closely integrated.

Cooperation and Competition Among Library Networks
.A
Robinson, B.M.
.W
    Recenty technological advances and the success of OCLC, Inc. has led
to the emergence of three additional nonprofit library networks:  the
Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) of the Research Libraries
Group, Inc., the University of Toronto Library Automation System (UTLAS),
and the Washington Library Network (WLN).  This paper examines the economic
and technological factors affecting the evolution of these networks and
also explores the role of those state and regional (multistate) networks
that broker OCLC services.  The competitive and cooperative nature of
network relationships is a major theme of the discussion.

Searching Biases in Large Interactive Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Blair, D.C.
.W
    The way that individuals construct and modify search queries on a
large interactive document retrieval system is subject to systematic biases
similar to those that have been demonstrated in experiments on judgements
under uncertainty.  These biases are shared by both naive and sophisticated
subjects and cause the inquirer searching for documents on a large interactive
system to construct and modify queries inefficiently.  A searching algorithm
is suggested that helps the inquirer to avoid the effect of these biases.

A Program for Machine-Mediated Searching
.A
Toliver, D.
.W
    A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic data
base searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) is
being developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providing
feedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed.
Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available to
users.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere,
is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers.
This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which
is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science
Information Services.

User-Responsive Subject Control in Bibliographic Retrieval Systems
.A
Tague, J.M.
.W
    A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of
user queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and
the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system
keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.
Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at
the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western
Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a
statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval
tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results
showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but
indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and
maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.

Brief Communications
.A
Harding, A.G.
Willett, P.
.W
    Some of the automatic classification procedures used in information
retrieval derive clusters of documents from an intermediate similarity
matrix, the computation of which involves comparing each of the documents
in the collection with all of the others.  It has recently been suggested
that many of these comparisons, specifically those between documents
having no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the uyse of an inverted
file to the document collection.  This communication shows that the
approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisons
only if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexing
terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be compared
several times over and the computation will be greater than when
conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.

The Combined Use of Bibliographic Coupling and Cocitation for Document
Retrieval
.A
Bichteler, J.
Eaton, E.A. III
.W
    A linkage similarity measure which takes into account both the bibliographic
coupling of documents and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers)
produced improved document retrieval over a measure based only on
bibliographic coupling.  The test collection consisted of 1712 papers whose
relevance to specific queries had been judged by users.  To evaluate the
effect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measures
of similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.
Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two ordered
lists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partial
relevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.
Overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling measure to the linkage
similarity measure, representing the introduction of cocitation data,
resulted in better retrieval performance.

Co-Citation Context Analysis and the Structure of Paradigms
.A
Small, H.
.W
    Many information scientists are concerned with the operation of
document retrieval systems serving scientists in various fields.  The
scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called
invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with
one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often
such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding
this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.

    The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify
paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize
the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.'
Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already
knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in
which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we
might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the
papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A'
and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner.
Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors
combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some
predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is
given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from
two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs
in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus
regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For
concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with
concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs)
connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is
similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in
our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.

Indexing Consistency, Quality and Efficiency
.A
Rolling, L.
.W
    Indexing quality determines whether the information content of an indexed
document is accurately represented.  Indexing effectiveness measures whether
an indexed document is correctly retrieved every time it is relevant to a
query.  Measurement of these criteria is cumbersome and costly; data base
producers therefore prefer inter-indexer consistency as a measure of indexing
quality or effectiveness.  The present article assesses the validity of this
substitution in various environments.

Parallel Computations in Information Retrieval
.A
Salton, G.
Bergmark, D.
.W
    Conventional information retrieval processes are largely based on data
movement, pointer manipulations and integer arithmetic; more refined retrieval
algorithms may in addition benefit from substantial computational power.

    In the present study a number of parallel processing methods are described
that serve to enhance retrieval services.  In conventional retrieval
environments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are of
greatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processors
also proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examined
and evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processing
and fast computational facilities in information retrieval.

"Electronic Mail," "Electronic Communications," "Convergence," "Information
Management."  These are all terms included in the current list of buzz words
used to describe current activities in the office technology area.  The high
level of investment in factories and plants and the ever-increasing fight to
improve productivity by automating the dull, routine jobs are usually quoted
and compared with the extremely low investment in improving and automating
the equally tedious routine jobs in the office environment; the investment
in the factory is quoted as being ten times greater per employee than in the
office.  This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale
is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard,
forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their
office operations.

Fuzzy Requests:  An Approach to Weighted Boolean Searches
.A
Bookstein, A.
.W
    This article concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to
represent the relative importance of various index terms in a Boolean
request while retaining the desirable properties of a Boolean system.
The character of classical Boolean systems is reviewed and related to the
notion of fuzzy sets.  The fuzzy set concept then forms the basis of the
concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are assigned to index terms.
Ther properties of such a system are discussed, and it is shown that such
systems retain the manipulability of traditional Boolean requests.

A Model of Cluster Searching Based on Classification
.A
Croft, W.B.
.W
    The use of document clusters has been suggested as an efficient file
organization for a document retrieval system.  It is possible that by
using this information about the relationships between documents that the
effectiveness of the system (i.e., its ability to distinguish relevant
from non-relevant documents) may also be improved.  In this paper a
probabilistic model of cluster searching  based on query classification is
described.  This model is tested with retrieval experiments which indicate
that it can be more effective than heuristic cluster searches and cluster
searches based on other models.  It can also be more effective than a full
search in which every document is compared to the query.  The efficiency
aspects of the implementation of the model are discussed.

Using an Online Microfiche Catalog for Technical Service and Retrieval of

    A prototype system is created that integrates a microfiche catalog
into an online computer system for bibliographic control.  Costs and
operational data are collected and analyzed.  The system permits the more
economical microfiche storage of catalog records than would be feasible
for comparable online magnetic disk storage.  Experimental tests
demonstrate the feasibility of the online microfiche catalog system for use
in library technical services and retrieval of bibliographic data.  The
primary result of the project is the creation of a completely operational
facility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data bases
necessary to demonstrate the system.  A second set of results is derived
from the experimental use of the system and the evaluation of costs and
times for various operations.  The cost effectiveness of the online microfiche
catalog is demonstrated.
